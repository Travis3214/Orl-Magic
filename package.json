As a basketball player growing up in Central Florida I became a die hard Orlando Magic fan. I wanted to build a website for my favorite team in which the community can come together to support. The goal is to create a Full-Stack application using React to view the teams roster and upcoming schedule. I want users to be able to login and post threads/comments to spark conversation around our young up and coming team.",
