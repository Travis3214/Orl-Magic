# Orlando Magic

## Description
This is a personal project im building to help develop my skills in react. I wanted to build something im passionate about in my persoanl life. As a basketball player growing up in Central Florida I became a die hard Orlando Magic. I wanted to build a website my favorite team in which the community can come together to support. The goal is to create a full stack application using react to see the teams roster and upcoming schedule. I want users to be able to login and post threads/comments to spark conversation around our up and coming team.
